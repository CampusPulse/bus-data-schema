Apex is comprised of two large buildings that each house hundreds of people, so fire alarms are common. Unfortunately, its very easy to set off a building-wide fire alarm, forcing everyone in the building to evacuate. The mailroom leaves much to be desired, as packages can take up to a week to be processed and available for pickup after delivery. The construction is cheap, and the bedrooms are small. One of the best things about Apex is the kitchens: they are large and feature good appliances."],
